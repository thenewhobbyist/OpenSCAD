This is an updated version of jonnyhoeven's Stencil font for write.scad. I had issues with overlapping characters so I went ahead and made some modifications to the spacing, width, and shape of some of the characters. All of the characters should now be pretty well spaced and close to the same size.

Looks best when spacing is set to "1.2".

Change log:

v1.1 Update: corrected a spacing issue and improved the look of the "J" character.

v1.3 Update: corrected spacing issue with the letter "I". Also adjusted shape of letter "Z" to better fit with the rest of the font's characters.

v1.4 Update: Lots of new characters! I've added the following characters to the font: 1234567890 (:^-+)<*%.,>[;|!#]
