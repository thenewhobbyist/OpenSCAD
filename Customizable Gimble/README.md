Description: 
This model was insirped by DesignMakeTeach's print in place gimbal designs 
on Thingiverse. Below I have linked an example. I personalized one of these
for myself and thought I'd make it a full on Customizer model. To do this
I recreated something similar to DesignMakeTeach's design in OpenSCAD and 
used the Stencil-o-Matic from Benjamin to add in some easy customization.

Usage: 

Upload an image to Benjamin's "Stencil Factory" here: http://chaaawa.com/stencil_factory/
to generate data for your gimbal. Paste the code into the "input" field of Customizer.
You can make additional changes to the size and position of your image within Customizer.
