Customizable Wire Access Grommet
=============================
I've updated my "[Wire access grommit](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7902)" to include some customizable settings. 

You can use [Thingiverse Customizer](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:273159) or just manually edit the file to get a customized wire grommet for running cables through tables and such.
